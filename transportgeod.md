title: Transport geodesics
---

The concept of _transport geodesics_ was introduced in [[1] and [4]](/_pages/research). 
They are traces of individual masses that move along a sequence of optimal transport plans. 
All such traces turn out to be geodesics under the assumption that the concatenation of those transport plans is also optimal 
(i.e., triangle inequality for L<sup>1</sup>-Wasserstein metric holds with equality).
In short, transport geodesics are shortest paths which are constructed from optimal transport plans.

Here I draw transport geodesics on certain graphs. Masses are transported through a sequence of probability measures 1<sub>v<sub>0</sub></sub>,
&mu;<sub>v<sub>0</sub></sub>, &mu;<sub>v<sub>1</sub></sub>, ..., &mu;<sub>v<sub>n</sub></sub>, 1<sub>v<sub>n</sub></sub>, 
where v<sub>0</sub>,v<sub>1</sub>,...,v<sub>n</sub> is a diametral geodesic, and  1<sub>v</sub> is the dirac measure on v, and &mu;<sub>v</sub> is uniformly distributed measure on the ball of radius 1 around v.
